# Dreamscape
With stunning character and background art, Dreamscape immerses the player into a beautiful and mysterious dreamworld which the protagonist must traverse. The story of Dreamscape mainly focuses on peopleâ€™s inner dreams and desires and how these desires interact with their true self. Through excellent story-telling, this game takes the reader through an engaging journey of personal conflict and introspection. This was a game project done for the 2022 Xbox Game Camp in the summer with three of my friends.
